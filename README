KGEM (Top down approach) v0.20
Basic functionality:

Read file with aligned reads (.sam).
Initialize population as random sample of fixed size from this reads.

Sequentially repeat KGEM steps until convergence:
    1. Rounding
    2. Frequency estimation (FEM)
    3. Allele frequency estimation (KGEM)

Output corrected haplotypes in fasta format.
--------
New features v0.20
- KGEM derandomized with maximization of hamming distance between seeds
- Monte Carlo parameters dropped.
- Threshold changed to min hamming distance between seeds
- Loop overflow condition added (get rid of infinite loops)

features v0.10:
- KGEM steps include threshold clean step:
    Drop all genotypes with frequency less than threshold level (Default 0.05%)

- Monte Carlo series of experiments support implemented:
    Run the whole procedure n times and select haplotypes which appeared at least m times
    (Default n:4, m:3)

example of usage:

java -jar KGEM.jar reads.sam -k 50 -mcn 4 -mcm 3 -tr 0.05
